# OpenCV

This is the whole extended implementation of the openCV where the reading, writing and rendering of the images has been done.
The CV2 handling with the videos has been done reading the videos in the frames and then writting each frame and then compiling the frame to make the video.
The change color in the video has been done.
The canny edge detection has been done on the boy photo.
